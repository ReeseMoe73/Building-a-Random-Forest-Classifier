# Building-a-Random-Forest-Classifier
classifying iris plants based on measurements of their petal widths and sepal lengths. The dataset contains four variables measuring various parts of iris flowers of three related species and a fourth variable with the species name.

A production-adjacent, scikit-learnâ€“based classification pipeline with robust preprocessing, validation, diagnostics, and feature-importance introspection. The script auto-configures itself to the Iris dataset if no external data are provided and can be pointed at your own train/test DataFrames with minimal ceremony.
